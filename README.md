# Optimized Search Algorithms

This branch (`feature/improve-functionality`) introduces several key optimizations to the search algorithms, particularly focusing on binary search and its variants. The improvements aim to enhance both performance and code quality.

## Key Optimizations

### Memory Efficiency
- Reduced memory overhead by eliminating unnecessary variable allocations
- Implemented in-place operations where possible
- Optimized variable scope to improve garbage collection

### Performance Improvements

#### Binary Search
- Used bit shifting (`>>`) for faster division operations (`mid = left + ((right - left) >> 1)`)
- Minimized comparisons in the main loop
- Added early termination for common cases
- Implemented integer overflow protection

#### Binary Search with Bounds
- Added custom bounds support for targeted searches
- Optimized boundary checks
- Implemented the same bit-shifting optimizations as the basic binary search

#### Exponential Search
- Optimized initial bound selection
- Used bit shifting for faster power-of-2 calculations
- Reduced the number of comparisons in the probing phase
- Integrated with the optimized binary search for the final phase

#### Interpolation Search
- Improved position estimation formula
- Added protection against division by zero
- Optimized for uniformly distributed data
- Added bounds checking to prevent index out of range errors

### Code Quality Improvements

#### Type Safety
- Added comprehensive type hints
- Implemented TypeVar for generic type support
- Added runtime type checking where necessary

#### Documentation
- Added detailed docstrings with complexity analysis
- Included usage examples
- Added parameter descriptions
- Documented edge cases and limitations

#### Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests
- Included performance benchmarks
- Added edge case testing
- Implemented type compatibility tests

## Performance Benchmarks

The optimized implementations show significant improvements:

- Binary Search: O(log n) with reduced constant factors
- Exponential Search: O(log i) where i is the position of the element
- Interpolation Search: O(log log n) for uniformly distributed data

## Usage

```python
from searches.binary_search import (
    binary_search,
    binary_search_with_bounds,
    exponential_search,
    interpolation_search
)

# Basic binary search
result = binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)  # Returns 2

# Binary search with custom bounds
result = binary_search_with_bounds([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, left=1, right=3)

# Exponential search (good for unbounded arrays)
result = exponential_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)

# Interpolation search (optimal for uniform distributions)
result = interpolation_search([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 3.0)
```

## Future Improvements
- Implement parallel search for large datasets
- Add adaptive search strategy selection based on input characteristics
- Optimize memory usage further for large arrays
- Add support for custom comparator functions

## Running Tests
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_binary_search.py
```
